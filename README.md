# Text-Recognition-Python
Text Recognition/Optical Character Recognition is the system that converts the text available in the image to a machine readable format. It is designed to read the all characters seen in the image to a machine interpretable text.
This algorithm allows computers to analyze printed/handwritten documents automatically and prepare text data into editable formats for computers to efficiently process them.

<h3>OCR and Computer Vision</h3>
This is a real-time text recognition project.
Here the concepts of OCR and Computer Vision are implemented.
The algorithm is completely written in Python using Jupyter Notebook.

<h3>Py-tesseract</h3>
Here for the OCR py-tesseract is used. It will recognize and "read" the text embedded in images. It can read text from any source whether it maybe images or license plates or handwritten documents.

<h3>OpenCv</h3>
The other main concerned library is OpenCv. This library is used to enable the real time accessibility of the sources to recognize characters from. The main functionality of this tool is to enable (create environment for) the real time computer vision based applications.  
  
<p>Firstly it is tested on images consisting of textual characters. Bounding boxes are formed and after successful isolation of characters in images, then it is applied on video files. 

The system can detect, isolate and recognize characters from images, videos and real-time video frame where background is white and text are in black color as this is just a simple implementation of text recognition in python.
